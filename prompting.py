Abstract:
Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS, M146510) was first described in 1980 in six newborns. It is a pleiotropic disorder of human development that comprises hypothalamic hamartoma, central polydactyly, and other malformations. This disorder is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and has been mapped to 7p13 (S. Kang et al.Autosomal dominant Pallister-Hall syndrome maps to 7p13. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 59, A81 (1996)), co-localizing the PHS locus and the GLI3 zinc finger transcription factor gene. Large deletions or translocations resulting in haploinsufficiency of the GLI3 gene have been associated with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS; M175700) although no mutations have been identified in GCPS patients with normal karyotypes. Both PHS and GCPS have polysyndactyly, abnormal craniofacial features and are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but they are clinically distinct. The polydactyly of GCPS is commonly preaxial and that of PHS is typically central or postaxial. No reported cases of GCPS have hypothalamic hamartoma and PHS does not cause hypertelorism or broadening of the nasal root or forehead. The co-localization of the loci for PHS and GCPS led us to investigate GLI3 as a candidate gene for PHS. Herein we report two PHS families with frameshift mutations in GLI3 that are 3' of the zinc finger-encoding domains, including one family with a de novo mutation. These data implicate mutations in GLI3 as the cause of autosomal dominant PHS, and suggest that frameshift mutations of the GLI3 transcription factor gene can alter the development of multiple organ systems in vertebrates.

Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a complex developmental disorder in humans, characterized by hypothalamic hamartoma, central polydactyly, and other malformations. This autosomal dominant disorder has been linked to the 7p13 locus, where the GLI3 zinc finger transcription factor gene is located. Large deletions or translocations causing haploinsufficiency of the GLI3 gene have been associated with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS), another autosomal dominant disorder with similar but distinct clinical features. Despite the co-localization of PHS and GCPS loci, no GCPS mutations have been identified in patients with normal karyotypes. This study reports two PHS families with frameshift mutations in GLI3, located 3' of the zinc finger-encoding domains, including one family with a de novo mutation. These findings suggest that GLI3 mutations are the cause of autosomal dominant PHS and that frameshift mutations in the GLI3 gene can affect the development of multiple organ systems in vertebrates.

Abstract:
Duloxetine, a potent reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine, is effective for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic neuropathic pain, stress urinary incontinence, generalized anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia. Duloxetine achieves a maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of approximately 47 ng/mL (40 mg twice-daily dosing) to 110 ng/mL (80 mg twice-daily dosing) approximately 6 hours after dosing. The elimination half-life of duloxetine is approximately 10-12 hours and the volume of distribution is approximately 1640 L. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may impact the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine with a focus on concomitant medications and their clinical implications. Patient demographic characteristics found to influence the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine include sex, smoking status, age, ethnicity, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotype, hepatic function and renal function. Of these, only impaired hepatic function or severely impaired renal function warrant specific warnings or dose recommendations. Pharmacokinetic results from drug interaction studies show that activated charcoal decreases duloxetine exposure, and that CYP1A2 inhibition increases duloxetine exposure to a clinically significant degree. Specifically, following oral administration in the presence of fluvoxamine, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and C(max) of duloxetine significantly increased by 460% (90% CI 359, 584) and 141% (90% CI 93, 200), respectively. In addition, smoking is associated with a 30% decrease in duloxetine concentration. The exposure of duloxetine with CYP2D6 inhibitors or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers is increased to a lesser extent than that observed with CYP1A2 inhibition and does not require a dose adjustment. In addition, duloxetine increases the exposure of drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, but not CYP1A2. Pharmacodynamic study results indicate that duloxetine may enhance the effects of benzodiazepines, but not alcohol or warfarin. An increase in gastric pH produced by histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists or antacids did not impact the absorption of duloxetine. While duloxetine is generally well tolerated, it is important to be knowledgeable about the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between duloxetine and drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 or drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 enzymes.

Abstract:
Urinary incontinence is the inability to willingly control bladder voiding.  Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most frequently occurring type of incontinence in women.  No widely accepted or approved drug therapy is yet available for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence.  Numerous studies have implicated the neurotransmitters, serotonin and norepinephrine in the central neural control of the lower urinary tract function.  The pudendal somatic motor nucleus of the spinal cord is densely innervated by 5HT and NE terminals.  Pharmacological studies confirm central modulation of the lower urinary tract activity by 5HT and NE receptor agonists and antagonists.  Duloxetine is a combined serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of women with stress urinary incontinence.  Duloxetine exerts balanced in vivo reuptake inhibition of 5HT and NE and exhibits no appreciable binding affinity for receptors of neurotransmitters.  The action of duloxetine in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence is associated with reuptake inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine at the presynaptic neuron in Onuf's nucleus of the sacral spinal cord.  In cats, whose bladder had initially been irritated with acetic acid, a dose-dependent improvement of the bladder capacity (5-fold) and periurethral EMG activity (8-fold) of the striated sphincter muscles was found.  In a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in women with stress urinary incontinence, there was a significant reduction in urinary incontinence episodes under duloxetine treatment.  In summary, the pharmacological effect of duloxetine to increase the activity of the striated urethral sphincter together with clinical results indicate that duloxetine has an interesting therapeutic potential in patients with stress urinary incontinence.
Generated Lay Summarization:
Stress urinary incontinence (SUI), a common type of incontinence in women, lacks a universally approved drug therapy. The neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine have been implicated in the central neural control of lower urinary tract function, with the pudendal somatic motor nucleus of the spinal cord densely innervated by these neurotransmitters. Duloxetine, a combined serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is currently under investigation for treating SUI. It exhibits balanced in vivo reuptake inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine without significant binding affinity for neurotransmitter receptors. Duloxetine's therapeutic action in SUI is linked to reuptake inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine at the presynaptic neuron in Onuf's nucleus of the sacral spinal cord. In acetic acid-irritated bladders of cats, duloxetine improved bladder capacity and periurethral EMG activity of the striated sphincter muscles in a dose-dependent manner. Clinical trials in women with SUI demonstrated a significant reduction in incontinence episodes under duloxetine treatment. Hence, duloxetine's pharmacological effect of enhancing striated urethral sphincter activity, along with clinical results, suggests its promising therapeutic potential in SUI patients.

Generated Lay Summarization:
Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a complex genetic disorder affecting human development, characterized by a range of symptoms including brain abnormalities, extra fingers or toes, and other malformations. It is a hereditary condition, passed on in a pattern known as autosomal dominant inheritance. Previous research has linked PHS to a specific region of the 7th chromosome, where the GLI3 gene is located. This gene plays a crucial role in the development of many body systems in vertebrates. Interestingly, the GLI3 gene is also associated with another disorder, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS), which shares some symptoms with PHS, such as abnormal facial features and extra fingers or toes. However, GCPS and PHS are clinically different. For instance, the extra digits in GCPS typically occur on the thumb side of the hand (preaxial), whereas in PHS, they are usually in the middle or on the little finger side (central or postaxial). Moreover, brain abnormalities are common in PHS but not reported in GCPS, and certain facial features are seen in GCPS but not PHS. Given the shared location of the GLI3 gene and the PHS-associated region on the 7th chromosome, researchers investigated the GLI3 gene as a potential cause of PHS. They found that two families with PHS had mutations in the GLI3 gene that resulted in a change in the gene's structure. One of these mutations was not inherited but occurred spontaneously (a de novo mutation). These findings suggest that mutations in the GLI3 gene could be the cause of PHS. This discovery is significant as it not only provides a potential genetic explanation for PHS, but also highlights how changes in the GLI3 gene can impact the development of multiple organ systems in vertebrates. This could have broad implications for our understanding of genetic disorders and developmental biology.

Generated Lay Summarization:
Duloxetine is a medication known for its effectiveness in treating various conditions such as major depressive disorder, diabetic neuropathic pain, stress urinary incontinence, generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia. This paper reviews how different factors, both internal (like a patient's age, sex, or ethnicity) and external (like other medications they're taking), can affect how the body processes duloxetine. In terms of internal factors, the study found that patient characteristics such as sex, smoking habits, age, ethnicity, genetic makeup related to a specific liver enzyme (CYP2D6), and liver and kidney function can all influence how duloxetine is metabolized. However, only severe liver or kidney impairment were found to necessitate specific warnings or dosage adjustments. Regarding external factors, the study found that certain medications can significantly alter how duloxetine is processed in the body. For example, activated charcoal was found to decrease duloxetine exposure, while the inhibition of a specific enzyme (CYP1A2) by a drug called fluvoxamine significantly increased duloxetine exposure. In fact, the presence of fluvoxamine increased the maximum concentration and overall exposure of duloxetine by 141% and 460% respectively. Additionally, the study found that smoking can reduce duloxetine concentration by 30%. Interestingly, the study also found that duloxetine can increase the exposure of drugs metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme, but not those metabolized by CYP1A2. Furthermore, it was found that duloxetine can enhance the effects of benzodiazepines, a class of medications used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders, but not alcohol or warfarin, a common blood thinner. In conclusion, while duloxetine is generally well-tolerated, it's crucial for healthcare providers to be aware of potential interactions between duloxetine and other medications, especially those that inhibit the CYP1A2 enzyme or are metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme.

Despite its prevalence, there is currently no universally accepted drug treatment for SUI. This study explores the role of neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in the control of the lower urinary tract function. The researchers focused on the pudendal somatic motor nucleus area of the spinal cord, which is densely populated with serotonin and norepinephrine terminals. They found that these neurotransmitters play a significant role in modulating the activity of the lower urinary tract. The team then investigated the effects of Duloxetine, a drug that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, on SUI. The drug works by blocking the absorption of these neurotransmitters at the presynaptic neuron in a specific area of the sacral spinal cord. In their experiments, the researchers used cats with bladder irritation and found that Duloxetine significantly improved bladder capacity and the electrical activity of the muscles around the urethra. In a further clinical trial involving women with SUI, Duloxetine was found to significantly reduce episodes of urinary incontinence. In conclusion, the study suggests that Duloxetine, due to its ability to increase the activity of the muscles controlling the urethra, could be a promising potential treatment for patients with stress urinary incontinence.

Urinary incontinence, specifically stress urinary incontinence (SUI), is a common issue in women, characterized by the inability to control bladder emptying. Currently, there's no universally accepted drug therapy for SUI. However, research has shown that neurotransmitters, serotonin and norepinephrine, play a significant role in controlling the function of the lower urinary tract (the bladder and urethra). The pudendal somatic motor nucleus, a part of the spinal cord, is heavily influenced by these neurotransmitters. Medications that affect serotonin and norepinephrine receptors can alter the activity of the lower urinary tract. One such drug, Duloxetine, is currently being studied for its potential in treating SUI. Duloxetine works by inhibiting the reabsorption of serotonin and norepinephrine in the presynaptic neuron in Onuf's nucleus of the sacral spinal cord, an area that controls the muscles of the pelvic floor. In experiments with cats, duloxetine significantly improved bladder capacity and the electrical activity of the muscles around the urethra. In a clinical trial involving women with SUI, duloxetine treatment led to a significant decrease in urinary incontinence episodes. In conclusion, the ability of duloxetine to increase the activity of the urethral sphincter muscles, combined with promising clinical trial results, suggests that duloxetine could be a potential treatment for patients with stress urinary incontinence.

Generated Lay Summarization:
Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a disorder first identified in 1980 in six newborn babies. It affects many parts of the body, causing issues like a non-cancerous growth in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus (known as a hypothalamic hamartoma). The hypothalamus is a small area at the base of the brain that controls hormones and many body functions like temperature and hunger. PHS also leads to extra fingers or toes (called polydactyly) and other physical abnormalities. PHS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that if one parent carries the affected gene, there is a 50% chance their child will have the condition. The disorder is linked to a gene on chromosome 7 near a gene called GLI3. The GLI3 gene makes a protein that acts as a transcription factor, which is like a switch that turns other genes on or off to control cell activities. Another disorder, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS), is also associated with changes in the GLI3 gene. Both PHS and GCPS involve extra fingers or toes and unusual facial features, but they differ in other ways. In GCPS, the extra digits are usually on the thumb side of the hand or big toe side of the foot (preaxial polydactyly). In PHS, the extra digits are typically in the middle of the hand or on the little finger side (central or postaxial polydactyly). Additionally, people with GCPS do not have the brain growths seen in PHS, and those with PHS do not have features like widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) or a broad nasal bridge found in GCPS. Scientists studied families with PHS and found mutations in the GLI3 gene that cause frameshift mutations. A frameshift mutation is a genetic error where the addition or loss of DNA bases shifts the way the sequence is read, leading to incorrect protein production. In one family, the mutation occurred spontaneously (a de novo mutation), meaning it was not inherited from the parents. This evidence shows that mutations in the GLI3 gene cause PHS and can affect the development of many body systems."""

The goal of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may impact the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine with a focus on concomitant medications and their clinical implications. Patient demographic characteristics found to influence the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine include sex, smoking status, age, ethnicity, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotype, hepatic function and renal function. Of these, only impaired hepatic function or severely impaired renal function warrant specific warnings or dose recommendations. Pharmacokinetic results from drug interaction studies show that activated charcoal decreases duloxetine exposure, and that CYP1A2 inhibition increases duloxetine exposure to a clinically significant degree. Specifically, following oral administration in the presence of fluvoxamine, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and C(max) of duloxetine significantly increased by 460% (90% CI 359, 584) and 141% (90% CI 93, 200), respectively. In addition, smoking is associated with a 30% decrease in duloxetine concentration. The exposure of duloxetine with CYP2D6 inhibitors or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers is increased to a lesser extent than that observed with CYP1A2 inhibition and does not require a dose adjustment. In addition, duloxetine increases the exposure of drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, but not CYP1A2. Pharmacodynamic study results indicate that duloxetine may enhance the effects of benzodiazepines, but not alcohol or warfarin. An increase in gastric pH produced by histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists or antacids did not impact the absorption of duloxetine. While duloxetine is generally well tolerated, it is important to be knowledgeable about the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between duloxetine and drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 or drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 enzymes.

Generated Lay Summarization:
Duloxetine is a powerful drug mainly used to treat serious mood disorders, certain nerve related pain, stress related bladder issues, general anxiety disorder and a kind of muscle disorder named fibromyalgia. It reaches its highest concentration in our blood, somewhere between 47 to 110 ng/mL, approximately 6 hours after being consumed. It roughly takes 10-12 hours for our bodies to remove half of this drug. This paper reviews various factors that can influence how this drug behaves in our body while also considering the effect of any other medicines consumed along with it. The effects of Duloxetine are influenced by the patient's sex, whether they smoke, their age, race, specific type of genetic makeup associated with liver functionality (CYP2D6 genotype), and their liver and kidney health. However, we only need to be specially careful when Duloxetine is used in patients with poor liver or severe kidney dysfunctions. Activated charcoal can reduce the concentration of duloxetine in the body, while some substances that hinder a specific liver enzyme (CYP1A2) can significantly increase its concentration. For instance, using it with fluvoxamine increases Duloxetine's concentration by almost 460%. Also, smokers have 30% less concentration of duloxetine compared to non-smokers. A similar but lesser interaction is seen with inhibitors of another liver enzyme (CYP2D6) though it doesn't need dose adjustment. More interestingly, duloxetine can also multiply the concentrations of some drugs that are processed by this CYP2D6 liver enzyme but not the ones processed by CYP1A2. The study also discovered that duloxetine might boost the effects of a group of drugs called benzodiazepines, but it doesn't do the same with alcohol or warfarin (a blood thinner). Changing stomach acidity with common medicines like antacids doesn't affect duloxetine's absorption. Despite these multiple interactions, Duloxetine is generally safe to use but one must pay attention while using it in combination with substances that influence CYP1A2 or are processed by CYP2D6 enzymes."""

Abstract:
Urinary incontinence is the inability to willingly control bladder voiding.  Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most frequently occurring type of incontinence in women.  No widely accepted or approved drug therapy is yet available for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence.  Numerous studies have implicated the neurotransmitters, serotonin and norepinephrine in the central neural control of the lower urinary tract function.  The pudendal somatic motor nucleus of the spinal cord is densely innervated by 5HT and NE terminals.  Pharmacological studies confirm central modulation of the lower urinary tract activity by 5HT and NE receptor agonists and antagonists.  Duloxetine is a combined serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of women with stress urinary incontinence.  Duloxetine exerts balanced in vivo reuptake inhibition of 5HT and NE and exhibits no appreciable binding affinity for receptors of neurotransmitters.  The action of duloxetine in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence is associated with reuptake inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine at the presynaptic neuron in Onuf's nucleus of the sacral spinal cord.  In cats, whose bladder had initially been irritated with acetic acid, a dose-dependent improvement of the bladder capacity (5-fold) and periurethral EMG activity (8-fold) of the striated sphincter muscles was found.  In a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in women with stress urinary incontinence, there was a significant reduction in urinary incontinence episodes under duloxetine treatment.  In summary, the pharmacological effect of duloxetine to increase the activity of the striated urethral sphincter together with clinical results indicate that duloxetine has an interesting therapeutic potential in patients with stress urinary incontinence.
Generated Lay Summarization:
Urinary incontinence can be simply described as a person's inability to control when they pee. It's like when you really need to go to the bathroom, but you can't find one. A specific type of this problem, called stress urinary incontinence (SUI), is quite common in women. Right now, we don't have a safe and effective medicine that everyone can use to treat this problem. Scientists have done a lot of studies that suggest two chemicals in the body might have something to do with this serotonin and norepinephrine. Think of them as messengers in your nervous system that controls you going to the bathroom. They're really active in part of your spinal cord that tells your bladder when to let go or hold on. Now, there's a new drug being studied called duloxetine that might be a game-changer. It would work by limiting how much serotonin and norepinephrine gets used up in the spinal cord, effectively strengthening the signals that tell your bladder when to release pee. Tests on cats showed that giving them this drug made their bladders hold more (5 times more, in fact) and made their bladder muscles work better (8 times better). That's huge! And in scientific tests on women with stress urinary incontinence - the kind where you might pee a little when you laugh, cough, or sneeze - the drug significantly reduced the number of times they had these "oops" moments. So, to sum it all up, this new drug duloxetine boosts the performance of the muscle that controls peeing. The lab results are very promising, meaning this could be a big step forward in treating people who struggle with stress urinary incontinence.
